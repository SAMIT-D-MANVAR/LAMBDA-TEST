Cross Browsing Testing compatibility with Lambda Test SaaS Application

What is Cross Browser Compatibility?
Cross Browser compatibility is the ability of a website or web application to function across different browsers and operating systems. Compatibility testing is a part of non-functional testing.

Why do we need Cross Browser Compatibility?
Once the application is stable, we moved it to the production, it may be used or accessed by multiple users on the different platforms, and they may face some compatibility issues, to avoid these issues, we do one round of compatibility testing. A simple website is comprised of 3 major technologies HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. In the backend, different technologies are used. But overall, in the front end in the rendering only these 3 main technologies are used. Each browser used different rendering engine. We need to understand that cross-browser compatibility is more related to siteâ€™s functionality than its looks. This means the site should perform equally under various web environments. Every website owner should ensure cross-browser compatibility of their website or applications. Each individual has its own preferred web browser hence there are fewer chances that the website developer and site visitor will use the same browser.

REAL TIME TESTING (LIVE TESTING)
Real-Time Testing allows you to perform live-interactive cross browser testing of your website on more than 2000+ real browsers & browser versions running on various operating systems in the cloud. Lambda Test provides you real-time testing experience by virtual machines hosted on our cloud servers.

AUTOMATION TESTING
Automation testing is the process of testing software and other tech products to ensure it meets strict requirements. Essentially, it's a test to double-check that the equipment or software does exactly what it was designed to do. It tests for bugs, defects, and any other issues that can arise with product development.
Automation testing with an example: -
Task is to mark two items as done in a to-do list website and also add a new item to the list.

Task Performed by Automation Testing

STEPS INVOLVED
1)Driver code
The driver code with lambda test credentials.

2)Setting up
Setup to select the browser, operating system.

3)Testing
Actual testing.
Open the website and mark two items as done. Then add a new item to the list. Now check if there is a new item added to the list.

4)finishing
If new item is added to the list the test is completed successfully and the result is logged. Or else the test is marked as failed in the logs.
